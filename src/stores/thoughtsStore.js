Not even a library‚Äôs docs. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ immediately getting an answer from Gemini. With sample code. And it‚Äôs good! I had previously avoided coding with the help of AI, but now I guess I don‚Äôt have a choice! This feels like‚Ä¶ playing God of War, when Atreus jumps in with the solution to a puzzle before you‚Äôre ready. But I won‚Äôt complain!</p>',

Is it easy to read? What can I remove? Is my html well-structured? Can I reuse that function or component?</em></p>\n\n<p>On the design side, the questions are similar. <em>Can we simplify the navigation? What information does the user expect to see here? What can be nested into the next view?</em></p>\n\n<p>‚ÄúIn character, in manner, in style, in all things, the supreme excellence is simplicity.‚Äù<br />  ‚Äì  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</p>',
